Course: CSCI 3172
Activity: Lecture 7 — Fantastic Beasts (Single Feature Extension)
Feature Implemented: REMOVE CREATURE

What I added
------------
I implemented ONLY the **"Remove Creature"** feature. Each creature you add now appears as a card with a **Remove** button. Clicking that button deletes that creature from the current list and immediately updates the count badge.

How to use it
-------------
1) Open **index.html** in a browser (or deploy to Timberlea and visit your public URL).
2) Use the form to add a creature (name, type, habitat) and click **Add Creature**.
3) Each creature appears as a card with a **Remove** button. Press **Remove** to delete that creature.
