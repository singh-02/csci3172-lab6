- Stored in an array, with functions:
  addItem, removeItem, getItem, listItems, searchItems, calculateTotalValue.
- DOM manipulation to render and interact with items.
- Control flow via conditionals and loops.

Bonus Features Implemented:
- groupByCategory() using Map — UI section to display categories.
- findDuplicates() using Set — UI section to show duplicate names.

Notes on Customization:
- Currency display uses Intl.NumberFormat;

Attribution:

Validation & Cross-Browser:
- JS cannot be W3C validated like HTML/CSS, but the app is vanilla JS and should work on modern browsers.
- Tested locally in Chromium-based and WebKit-based browsers.
